# Message Processing System Architecture and Design

## Overview

The Message Processing System is designed to handle the asynchronous processing of messages with varying priorities. It consists of several key components working together to ensure efficient message handling and user interaction.

## Architecture

The architecture of the Message Processing System can be divided into the following components:

1. **Priority Message Queue**:
   - Manages the queue of messages awaiting processing.
   - Utilizes a priority queue data structure to ensure higher priority messages are processed first.
   - Implements synchronization mechanisms such as locks and conditions to handle concurrent access safely.

2. **Thread Pool**:
   - Manages the execution of multiple threads within the system.
   - Includes a user input thread for interacting with the system and a message processing thread for handling message processing tasks.
   - Utilizes the ThreadPoolExecutor class to manage the concurrent execution of threads.

3. **Message Sending Function** (Optional):
   - Provides a function or interface for sending messages to the system for processing.
   - Not explicitly shown in the provided code but can be integrated into the system as needed.

## Design

### Priority Message Queue Design:
- **Message Class**: Represents individual messages with attributes such as content, priority, and ID.
- **ProcessThread Class**: Manages the processing of messages within a separate thread.
  - Utilizes a PriorityQueue to store messages based on their priority.
  - Implements methods for enqueueing messages, processing messages, and peeking at message details.
- **Concurrency Control**: Uses locks and conditions to ensure thread safety when accessing shared resources such as the message queue.

### Thread Pool Design:
- **UserInputThread Class**: Handles user interaction and input processing within a separate thread.
- **ThreadPoolExecutor**: Manages the execution of multiple threads concurrently.
- **Synchronization**: Ensures proper synchronization between threads to avoid race conditions and ensure consistent behavior.

### Interaction Flow:
1. The UserInputThread prompts the user for input and adds messages to the processing queue based on user input.
2. The ProcessThread continuously monitors the message queue and processes messages as they arrive, ensuring higher priority messages are processed first.
3. The user can also query the system to peek at details of specific messages in the queue.
4. The ThreadPoolExecutor manages the execution of both the UserInputThread and ProcessThread, allowing for concurrent execution.

## Conclusion

The Message Processing System architecture and design are structured to efficiently handle asynchronous message processing while providing a user-friendly interface for interaction. By separating concerns and utilizing proper synchronization mechanisms, the system ensures reliable and consistent behavior in handling messages of varying priorities.
